Since we're experiencing SSL issues with direct upload, here's how to train your model:

1. Go to: https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-lora-fast-training/playground

2. Log in with your GitHub account

3. Upload your 17 training images from:
   ./training-images/TRAININGFORAI/

4. Use these training settings:
   - Trigger word: COOLSHIRT
   - Steps: 1200
   - Learning rate: 0.0001
   - Resolution: 1024
   - LoRA rank: 16

5. Add this caption prefix:
   "COOLSHIRT style, vector design, white background"

6. Start training (will take ~15-30 minutes)

7. Once complete, save the model URL

ALTERNATIVE: Use the FAL CLI:

1. Install FAL CLI:
   npm install -g @fal-ai/cli

2. Login:
   fal auth login

3. Upload and train:
   fal models train flux-lora \\
     --trigger-word "COOLSHIRT" \\
     --steps 1200 \\
     --images ./training-images/TRAININGFORAI/*.png

Your API key is already configured.
